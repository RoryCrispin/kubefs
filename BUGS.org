#+title: Bugs


* Don't effectively report the status of pods in errors
for example - when running an exec on an ImagePullBackoff pod, the container is just 'not found'


* Doesn't respond to interrupts
 - would be good to cancel an exec when the write is interrupted

* The resources directory structure should work like so

resources/pods/v1/ <- list of pods
resources/pods/metrics.k8s.io <- list of metrics

so when there is a collision you just disambiguate it in the next directory, this is
better than having to memorise all of the groupversions upgfont.

When there is no disambiguation to do, perhaps we just inline the pods onto the disambiguation dir to save some time?

* Unify the unstructured resources with the corev1 resources
so if the resource is well-know we just offer more actions against it
